As I began my new grad job search, I had exactly one mission I needed to accomplish otherwise I would die: move to New York City.

The entire process revolved around this vision, with a New York office being the primary prerequisite.

After ten or so months of bulldozing through the Lower East Side, Brooklyn Mirage, and Marquee, I realize I may move back to the bay sooner than I think.

Paul Graham wrote a great essay on [Cities and Ambition](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html). The summary is as follows: each great city sends a message. In New York City, the message is “you should make more money.” In the Bay Area, it is “you should be more powerful.”

After comparing my experiences on both coasts, my experiences have led me to believe this is incredibly true.

I spent two years at New York University, where student culture is heavily influenced by New York City. I have a distinct memory of standing outside NYU Stern as I watched a herd of undergrads exit the building. The first thing I noticed was that all of them were extremely well dressed. Students willingly displayed their wealth in terms of the clothes they wore, the high end restaurants they ate at, the Broadway shows they saw, and the fancy bars they went to.

Status is also a secondary value of New York City, which makes sense. Oftentimes, status is a proxy for money. This also bleeds into the culture of NYU: the student body has a non-trivial amount of Instagram famous models, TikTokkers, and YouTubers. This also explains the two respectable fields of study of NYU: business and the arts. NYU Stern places well into investment banking roles, a role centered on wealth creation. NYU Tisch produces significant amounts of notable alumni in entertainment.

I’m not too interested in business, and obviously I am not training to be the next Lady Gaga. My intuition told me to leave, but only now as I’ve matured can I really articulate why NYU was not the right place for me. Graham summarizes this quite concisely:

> “No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced by the people around you. It's not so much that you do whatever a city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around you cares about the same things you do.”

Ultimately, I think I sensed that my ambitions, values, and goals were different from the students around me. So I took the leap and transferred to the University of California, Berkeley.

Upon arriving at Berkeley, the first most obvious difference I saw was how people dressed. Campus attire was a hoodie and sweatpants. Even on a night out at the college bars, you would occasionally see students wearing this hoodie and sweatpants uniform.

The second thing I sensed was that the student body was really…humming with a humble and quiet ambition. Students studied very hard and were open about how hard they worked, but I rarely encountered peers who would brag about their accomplishments. This was quite different from my experience at NYU. In my freshman year at NYU, the topic of math courses came up in conversation, and I had a student directly tell me they were better at math than I was. I never encountered anything remotely similar at Berkeley.

The final thing I noticed was how extremely broken and dirty some of my friends’ cars were. My friend accidentally knocked off her rearview mirror from a parking mishap, and for the remainder of the school year, the mirror remained attached to the car via duct tape.

These differences are quite indicative of how different UC Berkeley’s values are from NYU. Hard work and intellect are both extremely respected at Berkeley, whereas how much money you have, how nice your car is, how attractive you are, or how well you dress is not really valued. If UC Berkeley were to send a message, it would be “you should work harder”. If NYU were to send a message, it would be “you should be richer”.

I speak very highly of Berkeley because I genuinely think the environment pushed me to grow in the ways I wanted to, and I will forever be grateful for my peers because of this.

Now that I’m in back in New York City working full time, this underlying message of “you should make more money” has crept back into my life. I’ve noticed that an overwhelmingly popular activity amongst young professionals is going out to eat. There seems to be this mysterious obsession with getting reservations at certain restaurants, such as Don Angie. Curious about the hype, my friends and I attempted to run a Resy bot to secure a reservation at this extremely hot restaurant. However, the Resy bot failed to beat the army of 1000 secretaries refreshing the page at exactly 9:00 AM as well, and we gave up.

I was curious to see if my shift in social circles would cause the message of money to be less apparent, as I mostly spend time with Berkeley alumni who also moved to New York City. After all, your friends are a significant part of your environment, so surely, by selecting the friends I surround myself with, I can self select my environment. But despite this, I think the overall push of the city is hard to ignore. My friend told me a funny story—she went on a date, and she asked her date how his day was. But I think he misheard and replied, “I work at Goldman Sachs”. There are also running jokes of which are the best bars or clubs to go to if you’re looking to date a “finance bro”, which is cool, but meeting professionals in finance is not something I am super interested in.

Given this, my (maybe) controversial opinion is that New York City will never replace the Bay Area as the primary hub for tech talent, and thus opportunities in tech. Some of my friends disagree, saying it is not so black and white: NYC is a better place for fintech, or certain niches in tech whose primary motivation is, unsurprisingly, to make money (quant firms). For software engineers that are moving to NYC, they also claim “everyone is moving here”, given how exciting this place is. While yes, with remote work, there is an influx of talent moving towards New York, I don’t think this shift is significant enough. I notice a non-trivial proportion of top talent is not actually motivated by money, but rather a genuine curiosity or desire to build things. Graham touches on this briefly too, saying New Yorkers admire money more than power, so NYC is not really conducive to becoming a tech hub.

I do think we are subconsciously drawn to environments whose values align with ours, so this is really a self fulfilling cycle: talents in tech don’t resonate with the values of NYC, and thus they are more comfortable in the bay. As a result, the majority of opportunities in tech are inevitably going to remain in the bay, where the talent is.

Ultimately, New York is fun, but the bay feels like home. I miss how I usually get along with most new people I meet there, whereas this is less true for me in New York. So who knows, my chapter in New York may close sooner than I think.
